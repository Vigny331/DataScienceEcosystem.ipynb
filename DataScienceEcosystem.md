### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in python.


```python
print ("This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.")

(3*4)+5
```

    This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.

```python
print ("This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.")

total_minutes = 200

# Calculate hours and remaining minutes
hours = total_minutes // 60
minutes = total_minutes % 60

# Print the result
print(f"{total_minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours and {minutes} minutes.")




```

    This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
    200 minutes is equal to 3 hours and 20 minutes.
